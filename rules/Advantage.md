# ADVANTAGE

When performing rolls, you may come across a situation where external variables enhance or decrease your ability to perform an action. We call this advantage. You gain or lose advantage, based on the variables in play. Gaining or losing Advantage is at the discretion of the CC. 

## POSITIVE ADVANTAGE: 

When you have Net 1 Advantage, you roll your die twice and take the higher of those two rolls. If you have any greater than Net 1 Advantage, you add 2 to your rolls for every advantage you have past 1.	   *(Net 3 Advantage = Roll twice, add 4 to both rolls & Use the higher of both rolls)*

## NEGATIVE ADVANTAGE:  

When you have Net -1 Advantage, you roll your die twice and take the lower of the two rolls. If you have any less than -1 advantage, you subtract 2 from both those rolls for every advantage you have less than 1. *(Net -5 Advantage = Roll twice, subtract 6 from both rolls & Use the lower of both rolls)*

## NEUTRAL ADVANTAGE: 

Most rolls are going to be made with Net 0 advantage. These are handled normally.
You cannot roll a Natural 20 or Natural 1 by using the modifiers gained or lost by advantage. However, a Natural 20 and a Natural 1 still count if they are naturally rolled (REFERENCE).

## COMBAT ADVANTAGE: 

There are specific scenarios that will give a character advantage in combat. Advantage in combat only affects accuracy rolls. 

-	Support: +1 advantage for every adjacent friendly character who is also in combat.
-	Surprise Attack: +1 advantage when attacking creatures that are not in combat yet.
-	Sneak Attack: +1 advantage when attacking creatures that do not know your location.
-	High Ground: +1 Advantage if they are at least 5 feet above their target.
-	Prone: +1 advantage if their target is laying on the ground. 
-	Pinned: +1 Advantage if target is pinned.
-	Heavy Fog: -1 Advantage if there is a heavy fog (or similar situation)
-	Multitasking: -1 Advantage if a character is using 1 AP to perform 2 actions. (REFERENCE)
-	Cover:  -2 advantage if target is behind full cover (more than 3/4 covered).-1 advantage if target is behind half cover (more than 1/2 but less than 3/4 covered)

## NON-COMBAT ADVANTAGE:  

Following is a list on non-combat related ways to gain advantage. You may also gain these advantages while in combat, but they cannot affect accuracy rolls.

-	Aid: A character may receive Aid while trying to perform an action. While receiving aid, gain +1 Advantage to rolls associated with that action. Aid can only be received from one character at a time.
