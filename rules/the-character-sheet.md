# CHARACTER SHEET
Your character sheet is made up of your **Basic Info**, **Stats**, **Weapons**, **Wearables**, **Usable Items**, **Class Abilities**, **Character Info**, **SURONIS**, and **Notes**.

## BASIC INFO: 
Your basic info inclused your Level, Movement Speed, Max Health Points, Current Health Points, Armor Value, and Dodge Value. (There is a summary on the character sheet)

#### LEVEL (LVL): 
Level is determined by the CC. Using story-based milestones, the CC will level up every character in the party at once. When you level up, you increase your **MAX HP** (REFERENCE) & gain an upgrade point to unlock a new ability or modification from your Class Ability list (REFERENCE).
#### MOVEMENT SPEED (MS): 
Movement Speed is how many spaces you can move using a single action in combat (REFERENCE). Your MS is equal to your Speed Stat.
#### MAX HEALTH POINTS (MAX HP): 
Max HP is how much health you can have at once. You cannot heal past this amount. Your Max HP is determined by CONSTITUTION Stat x LVL + 5 *(CON 4, LVL 3 = Max HP 17)*
#### CURRENT HEALTH POINTS (CUR HP):
CUR HP is how many health points you have left. When taking damage, reduce your Max HP by how much damage you have taken. When this value reaches 0, you die (REFERENCE). CUR HP is determined by MAX HP – Damage Taken. *(MAX HP 20, Damage Taken 5 = 15 CUR HP)* 
#### ARMOR VALUE (AV): 
AV reduces attack damage by its value. Your Current Health Points are reduced by the difference between the attack damage and the Armor Value (REFERENCE). *(Attack Dam 15, AV 5 = Damage Taken 10)*           
Av is determined by taking the sum of all your wearable’s Armor Value. 	     
#### DODGE VALUE (DV): 
When making an attack (REFERENCE), the attacker must exceed the target’s DV with their accuracy roll to hit their target & Deal damage. DV is determined by Reflex Stat x 2 + Size Modifier  *(Ref 4, Size Mod 5 = DV 13)*    

## STATS:  
Your Stats determine how good you are at actions in the world of Avarice. They also determine your Energy Points (REFERENCE). Different weapons will also use a specific stat to determine Proficiency (REFERENCE) with that weapon. You will also use your stats to perform your Class Abilities (REFERECE)
You have a maximum Natural Stat of 7 & a maximum Equipment Stat of 3 for each Stat, coming to a maximum Stat Score of 10. Natural Stats are gained through Success Points and Leveling Up (REFERENCE). Equipment Stats are gained through augmentations on your equipped wearables or abilities (REFERENCE).
#### STAT TEST:  
    When attempting to perform an action, your CC may decide to have you perform a Stat Test.. The CC will determine the associated Stat and set a Difficulty Rating (DR) of 2,5,10,15,20, 25, or Crit (REFERENCE) depending on the estimated difficulty to perform said action. When performing a Stat Test, you roll one 20 sided die (1d20). To successfully perform the action, you must expend an energy point (REFERENCE) and your Test Result must be equal to or greater than the Difficulty Rating (DR). Your Test Result is equal to your roll + Stat Score. Crit difficulty can only be succeeded if you roll a Critical Success (REFERENCE). *(DR 15, Roll 10, Stat 5 = Success!)*. 		               Your Class abilities also act as Stat Tests and have a predetermined Stat and Difficulty Rating (REFERENCE).

#### ENERGY POINTS: 
With each Stat, there is an associated energy point total represented by a row of bubbles below each Stat. Your Maximum Energy point total is equal to each Stat Score .(REFERENCE) After rolling for a Stat Test, you expend an energy point. If you succeed, you add a success point to the associated stat. You only need to expend an energy point if they make the decision to perform that action. On a Critical Failure, lose an additional energy point and you automatically fail the Stat Test. (REFERENCE)           
#### EXHAUSTION POINTS: 
When you have expended all of your energy points, you can still perform actions using that Stat. But for every action performed without an energy point, gain 1 exhaustion point.

Whenever you perform a Stat Test with that associated stat test, you gain -2 to your roll for every point of exhaustion.        
#### COMBAT STATS: 
You have 2 combat stats. A Ranged Combat Stat and a Melee Combat Stat. When performing an attack (REFERENCE) with one of these stats, you add your stat to your accuracy roll. When rolling to attack, only expend 1/2 of an energy point, and on a hit, gain 1/2 of a success point.
#### SUCCESS POINTS: 
 When succeeding on a Test, you gain a Success Point. Success points are represented by the bubbles below your Energy Points. When rolling a Critical Success (REFERENCE), gain 2 Success Points. 
*Note: Some Tests won’t have a set Difficulty rating (i.e., Initiative, perception, and insight). The result on these tests will determine how well you perform the tasks. You cannot gain excel points from these tests. You also do not need to expend an energy point to perform these tests.* 
#### LEVELING UP STATS: 
When you get the chance to rest (REFERENCE), look at your Excel Points. If your Excel Points are equal to or greater than your Stat Score, then reset your Excel points to 0 and increase the associated Stat and your maximum Energy Points by 1.

Each of these items comes with its own advantages, abilities, & associated stat for proficiency. (REFERENCE)
#### RANGE: 
Every Weapon will have a minimum and maximum effective range. When attacking within this range, you simply add either your ranged or melee Stat to your accuracy roll, depending on the weapon type. For every space outside of the range the target is, however, gain -2 to the accuracy roll.

- D2 (flipping a coin)
- D4
- D6
- D8

#### PROFICIENCY: 
Your weapon’s proficiency will indicate a specific stat. Your Proficiency is equal to that stat’s Score. When rolling for Damage, you multiply whatever the Damage Die’s result is by your proficiency. *(Stat 6, Damage Die 5 = Damage 30)*

## WEARABLES: 
You can have 7 wearables equipped at any given time, one in each of the following areas: 
- Headwear
- Facewear
- Torso
- Arms
-  Hands
-  Legs
-  Feet
Each wearable will have a **name**, **description**, **specified body area(s)**, **Armor Value**, and it may have a **stat augmentation**. 
#### NAME: 
Whatever you or your CC has named this wearable.
#### DESCRIPTION: 
A physical description of the wearable. It can be heavy, hot, stylish, ragged, etc.
#### BODY AREA: 
This will determine where on your person you can wear this wearable. You cannot wear two wearables on the same body area. 
#### ARMOR VALUE:
Each wearable will have an armor value of some kind, even if that armor value is 0. (REFERENCE)
#### STAT AUGMENTATION: 
Some wearables will increase or decrease a stat. This will then be used to modify your Equipment Stat Score (REFERENCE). Equipment neither increase nor decrease your stats by more than 3. 

## USABLE ITEMS: 
You can have 3 separate Usable Items on your person at any given time. The items will be defined by a name, effect,  uses.

#### NAME: 
This is the name of the usable.
#### EFFECT: 
The effect will be what the usable does. 
#### USES:
 Certain items will have multiple, or unlimited uses. The item uses cannot be restored unless otherwise stated. Simply having 2 of the same item does not mean that you have 2 uses of the item & therefore means that you would need to use 2 Usable Item Slots to have both equipped. 

## CLASS ABILITIES: 
Each class will have access to a list of abilities that make each class unique. Each ability will have a pre-determined Test Difficulty (REFERENCE) and a description of what it does. You can unlock a new ability or augmentation with every level up that you have, starting at level one. 
#### ABILITIES: 
An ability is a unique action that your character can perform. These will be detailed on the Class sheet for the Class that you have selected (REFERENCE).
#### AUGMENTATIONS: 
Each ability, apart from the base ability, comes with 3 choices of augmentations that make this ability more powerful and useful in specific situations. Each ability comes with a Basic Augmentation, and 2 elemental Augmentations. 
#### UNLOCKING NEW ABILITIES & AUGMENTATIONS: 
When you reach level 1, you gain access to your class’ base ability. Every time you level up past that, you have the option to either unlock the next ability in your list or unlock an augmentation for an ability that you already have access to. You may only have one augmentation equipped to an ability at once.
#### CLASS LOADOUT: 
Class Loadouts are your current equipped abilities and modifiers. You may have every ability equipped at once, but only one augmentation can be attached to each ability at one time. If you have multiple augmentations unlocked for the same ability, you can change your loadout during a rest.
#### USING ABILITIES: 
Each ability will come with an associated Stat Test Difficulty (REFERENCE). When Performing an ability, you must make the associated Stat Test with the predetermined Difficulty Rating.
*Note: Most abilities will note how many actions that they take, if it does not specify, assume that it uses an Action Point.*

## CHARACTER INFO: 
Your character info is the meat and bones to roleplaying your character. Here you will describe your appearance, age, backstory, and any other important details about your character that develop during your adventures. 
## SURONIS: 
Your Spatially Unaware Rucksack of Nearly Infinite Space stores a digital copy of any item that you place within it. You can store as many kinds of items within the SURONIS as you wish. However, you cannot store more than 9 copies of the same item in the SURONIS because the display on the screen is not large enough to fit 2 numbers. When removing an item from the SURONIS, your digital copy is removed and formulated in the palm of your hand. It takes a full action to either formulate an item from your SURONIS or store one within your SURONIS. You cannot store living organic matter within the SURONIS. 
*Note: Any items removed from a SURONIS become appropriately sized for the character to whom the SURONIS belongs.* 

## NOTES: 
You might want to keep notes about the details of your adventures. Use this space to do so. Or not. You can draw pretty picture there if you want or use it as overflow for a complicated ability. It really doesn’t matter.
