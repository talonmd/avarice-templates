# NON-COMBAT: 
When outside of combat, you do not perform in a turn order. You can simply tell your CC that you would like your character to perform any possible action. The CC can then allow you to perform that action, make you roll with an associated stat to see if you perform that action, or tell you that that action is impossible. 
### COMMUNICATION: 
When communicating with other players or NPCs, you may roleplay out your conversation, or simply describe your interactions. This is at the discretion of the CC and the Player’s comfort. However, if the player ever attempts to deceive someone during this time, they must make a Contested Performance Test. When in combat, this can be done as a free action. If they wish to persuade a target, they must make a Contended Speech Test. 
### PICKPOCKETING:
 When attempting to steal an item from a character, you can make a Contested Reflex Test. Against their Practical Stat.  You can only steal items or weapons on their person. You cannot steal anything currently in their hands, that they are wearing as clothing, or in their SURONIS. 
### PERCEPTION TEST: 
Perception tests use your Practical Stat and are one of the few Tests that won’t produce an Excel Point. Perception Tests allow you to perceive things that may not be apparent at first glance. When making a Perception Test, you will tell your CC your Test result. Your CC will then tell you what your character perceives to be the truth based on that roll. However, the CC may give you inaccurate information if you roll poorly. It is up to you, regardless of the circumstances, to roleplay as if the information that you receive is accurate. When in combat, this can be done as a free action.
### INSIGHT TEST: 
Insight Tests use your Speech Stat and cannot produce an excel point. Insight is identical to Perception, except that Insight is used to perceive the intent, mindset, or hidden aspects of other characters. When in combat, this can be done as a free action.

# RESTING
Eventually, everyone needs a rest. Rests in Avarice are broken down into two categories: Slumbers & Naps. Resting allows you to recover Health & Energy Points (REFERENCE), change your Class Loadout (REFERENCE), and level up your stats if you have enough success points. You may not perform any other actions during a rest if you want to keep all the.
### SLUMBER: 
A slumber is an uninterrupted rest that lasts for 8 hours or more. During a slumber, you recover all your Health & Energy Points & are healed of any negative effects. You can change your class loadout during a Slumber.
### NAPS: 
Naps are rests that last less than 8 hours, but more than 1. Naps will allow you to recover 50% of your maximum Health & Energy Points. You cannot change a class loadout during a nap.
