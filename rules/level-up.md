# Level Up

The rate at which you level up is not based on your specific deeps, but instead upon specific mile points that you reach with your group. When you level up is at the discretion of the DM.

## Ability Scores:

On even level ups, you may put 2 level up ranks into your ability scores. You cannot have a natural ability score total more than 30, though you may have a score higher than 30 with the help of external modifiers and equipment.

## Skills:

For every level, you gain 4 rank that you can add to your skills. You cannot put more than 3 skills in any particular skill per level up.
