#COMBAT
Avarice is not known for being the most peaceful place. When there comes a point where one or more individuals becomes violent, everyone in the vicinity enters combat and rolls for Initiative. While in combat, you have 2 Action Points & 1 Minor action Point during your turn. You may choose to use all, some, or none of these actions. You also have unlimited free actions that can be performed at any time during your turn or on another character’s turn. You may also choose to check at any time on your turn. 

## INITIATIVE: 
When combat is initiated, everyone rolls for initiative. Initiaive acts like a Reflex Test. Whichever party has the highest total initiative goes first in the turn order. The Player’s Party can decide in which order the player’s take their turn. If there is contention, the CC can decide. However, after the initial turn order is decided, it remains until the end of combat. 
Note: If combat is initiated as a surprise. Any characters that were surprised roll for initiative with -1 advantage (REFERENCE)

## ACTION POINTS (AP): 
You have 2 actions on each of your turns. These actions can be used to perform any major action. (Moving, attacking, throwing items, using your SURONIS, etc.). Some feats may require more than one action to complete, this will be at the CCs discretion. 2 actions can be attempted using a single action point, like running and attacking, but any rolls made for these actions gain -1 advantage (REFERENCE). 

#### MOVING: 
Your movement is determined by your Movement Speed. You can move a number of spaces equal to your Movement Speed in any direction. Movement through difficult terrain or vertical movement counts as 2 spaces.
#### ATTACKING: 
Attacking uses a weapon to deal damage to another creature. When attacking, roll a for accuracy and damage at the same time. Then multiply your damage die by your proficiency with that weapon (PG. 3). If your Accuracy roll is higher than their Dodge Value, then you hit your target and deal damage to them. If you miss, then the CC determines where your attack did hit (if at all) and deals the intended damage to that location.
#### THROWING: 
When throwing a normal weighted and sized weapon (i.e., a football) you treat it like a Ranged STR Weapon. The Damage Die will be determined the CC & the Range is equal to your STR Stat. Light objects gain +1 Range, and then heavier and heavier items gain -1 range at the discretion of the CC. 
#### USING SURONIS: 
Pulling an item from, or putting an item into, your SURONIS takes a full action.
## MINOR ACTION POINTS (MAP): 
You have one Minor Action on each of your turns. Minor Actions are used to perform minor things (opening a door, using most consumables, etc.), or to Dash. You may use an Action to perform a minor action, if you have no more minor actions, but you cannot use a minor action to perform an action unless you perform a dash. 
#### BOOST: 
Successfully boosting allows you gain an additional Action Point this turn. Boosing uses up a minor action point. is a Speed Test, and the Difficulty Rating (DR) is always set to 15.
## FREE ACTION: 
Free actions are actions that can easily be performed while doing something else (talking, whistling, snapping, etc.) Perception and Insight Tests (REFERENCE) can be made as Free Actions.
## CHECK: 
Checking allows you to perform the remainder of your turn after another character in the combat order, or after a specific variable occurs. Checking cannot be used to interrupt another character’s turn unless you specifically define your intended action(s) when declaring your intention to check. If for whatever reason, the chosen character cannot perform their turn, or if the variable does not occur, then you lose the remainder of your turn. The act of checking is considered a free action, but whatever action points you use while checking are expended normally.
