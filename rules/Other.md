#CRITICALS
When performing an action, there is always a possibility of rolling either a 20 or a 1 on your d20. When these numbers are rolled naturally (without the use of modifiers) These are called Critical Successes and Critical Failures, respectively. 
###CRITICAL SUCCESS: 
When a Nat 20 is rolled, the action is automatically performed, regardless of difficulty. You also gain an additional Excel Point, regardless of the task’s difficulty. 
###CRITICAL FAILURE: 
When a Nat 1 is rolled, the action is failed & there are typically unintended consequences determined by the CC. You also must lose an energy point without being able to use it.

#CONTESTED TESTS
When performing a test against another creature’s ability, such as Pickpocketing, persuasion, seduction, etc. the CC determines the related stats. Then the difficulty of the test starts at 10, increasing by 5 for every point the defending creature has in their associated stat beyond what the assailing creature has in their associated stat. The difficulty rating also decreases by the same amount if the defending creature’s associated stat is less than the assailing creature’s associated stat.. 
For example: Assailing creature wants to pickpocket a creature. Pickpocketing is a Contested Reflex Test against their Practical Stat. Assailing Creature has a Reflex Stat of 4, Defending creature has a Practical stat of 5. Therefore, the Difficulty rating for the Assailing creature is 15. 

#DEATH
Death comes for us all in the end. When you reach 0 health points, your character is dead. At this point, another character can be created if you wish to continue playing in the campaign. 	 Note: There are certain abilities and usable items that can bring characters back from the dead, but they are rare, full of stipulations, and often come at a heavy price.
