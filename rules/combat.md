# Combat

Whenever you are attacking, or being attacked, you start combat turns. Each round of combat takes 15 seconds in game time.

## Initiative:

At the beginning of combat, every character rolls for initiative. The turn order then goes from the character that rolls the highest, to the lowest. The DM makes one roll for the entire group of identical NPCs.

## Your Turn:

On your turn, you have 2 actions and a bonus action to expend.

Actions are motions that take a effort or time. These include, but are not limited to:

- Movement up to your speed in feet.
- Casting a spell (unless spell explicitly states that it takes longer to cast)
- Attacking

Bonus actions are motions that can be performed while performing another action. These include, but are not limited to:

- Reloading your weapon
- Searching your environment
- Preparing for an attack from a specific direction or creature (this allows you to gain advantage if attacked)
- Ready an action.
- Opening a door.
- Interacting with an object in the environment.

If there is an action that you wish to perform that is not on the list, then the type of action is up to the discretion of the DM.

## Attacking:

When attacking, you simply select a target to attack and the weapon that you wish to use. Firstly, you roll 1d20 to determine whether or not you hit the creature. You then roll the amount of dice determined by adding the proficiency bonus to the amount of damage dice that your weapon allows (I.e. if you had a weapon that dealt 3d6 damage and you had a 3 proficiency bonus with that weapon, then you would deal 6d6 damage.) If you roll a Critical on your initial d20 roll, you then roll twice the amount of damage dice.

## Reactions:

If you are not surprised when attacked, you may roll 1d20 to determine the effectiveness of your reaction based on the following conditions:

- If you are being attacked with a melee attack, are wielding a melee weapon, and you pass your reaction, you may make an reaction attack to your assailant for half of your weapon's damage rounding down. If you are not wielding a melee weapon, and you pass your reaction roll, then you dodge the attack instead.
- If you are being attacked with a ranged attack and have a clear line of sight then you may make a reaction attack to your assailant for half your weapon's damage rounding down. If you are not wielding a ranged weapon and you pass your reaction roll, then you dodge the attack instead.

## Two-Weapon Fighting:

When you take the Attack action and Attack with a weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a Bonus Action to Attack with a different weapon that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus Attack.

## Dropping To 0 HP:

When you drop to 0 HP, you drop unconscious with Unconscious Health Points equal to 1/3rd your maximum HP. You cannot move or make any actions when unconscious. If the damage that reduced you to 0 HP has damage remaining, then that damage eats into that your UHP. Once the UHP has been reduced to 0, then you die.

The unconscious state ends if you regain any HP.

## Stabilizing:

Whenever you start Your Turn with 0 HP and were brought to that point with lethal damage, you must make a saving throw to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life.

_Roll 1 D20_: If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable and regain 1 health point. On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. (Rolling 1 or 20: When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on The D20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on The D20, you become stable and regain 1 hit point.)

## Knocking a Creature Out:

Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 HP with a bludgeoning attack, or with non-lethal damage the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls Unconscious and is stable.

## Suffocation:

A character can go without air for a number of minutes equal to four plus the character’s Constitution modifier. This time is halved if the character is performing strenuous activity. A character that runs out of air begins suffocating, and each round they must make a successful Physical Effect saving throw or fall unconscious.
