  "description": "Each religion prior to the humans landing has some personification of the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse. The accounts differ as to what they look like and who they are but they are all similar in personality and cause. War, Death, Famine, and Pestilence. But once humans arrived, every race on the planet who tangled with them knew humans were all four. With an insatiable lust for power and expansion, a breeding rate similar to rabbidevils, and a broken social structure, humans were programmed for destruction from the beginning.\nThey may seem mostly harmless but, underneath the surface, they harbor a deep-seated hatred for anything that isn't human. What they lack in strength, speed, and brains,  they make up for in unnerving determination. Early in their days on the planet, they renamed their race the Freemakers; a name they took when they 'freed' themselves and 'freed' the Dhuine. Freemakers also stamp their identity onto everything, making it difficult to let anything go.",
