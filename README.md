# Avarice Game Repository

**This repo is the single source of truth for all the data and information for Avarice**

## How it works

Everything is set up to be worked on in a text editor (_not_ a word processor). I highly reccommend you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Open the entire folder in your text editor (Visual Studio Code) and then you can proceed to work.

### There are two different types of files (so far)

#### Markdown (filename.md)

Markdown is a simple and easy-to-use markup language for formatting plain text ([learn more here](https://www.markdownguide.org/)). If you want help figuring it out, I reccommend having [this cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) open while you are writing your files.

Markdown files are to be used for any files that have a lot of writing in them, such as stories, information about races and classes, and so on.

#### JSON (filename.json)

JSON (stands for JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data ([learn more here](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp)). It has a specific format and syntax that you need to follow, but which is quite simple. I reccomend reading [this article](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp) to learn more about JSON and how to format the data you put in the files. There will also be a lot of examples and templates in the 'json-templates' directory on this repo.

JSON files are to be used to store data, such as any data that you may organize into a table to display, like all the stats on a weapon, for example.
