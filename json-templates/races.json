Notoriously cutthroat and brutal to those that oppose them, all of the gangs employ a generous amount of muscle to enforce their territory and their rules. Thankfully, the Bruttu are the perfect race for the job. Bruttu have never had it easy and it's mostly their fault.",

    "description": "Each religion prior to the humans landing has some personification of the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse. The accounts differ as to what they look like and who they are but they are all similar in personality and cause. War, Death, Famine, and Pestilence. But once humans arrived, every race on the planet who tangled with them knew humans were all four. With an insatiable lust for power and expansion, a breeding rate similar to rabbidevils, and a broken social structure, humans were programmed for destruction from the beginning. They may seem mostly harmless but, underneath the surface, they harbor a deep-seated hatred for anything that isn't human. What they lack in strength, speed, and brains,  they make up for in unnerving determination. Early in their days on the planet, they renamed their race the Freemakers; a name they took when they 'freed' themselves and 'freed' the Dhuine. Freemakers also stamp their identity onto everything, making it difficult to let anything go.",

    "description": "The earliest sighting of what are known as true angels were when the first race appeared on the planet. For many millennia until the humans arrived, the angels were responsible for greeting the newest race and explaining what the planet is. Existing as dimension traveling beings, true angels guide and protect the innocent. However, they have not been sighted since the humans arrived. Instead, the humans, who after seeing their beautiful form, decided they could create their own angels. They created synthetic humans that act as angels do, filling the role of divine intervention for any religion that would buy the robot. This offended the true angels and they have not been seen since. Guardian angels are, in every sense of the word, immortal. They don't require sleep, food, or drink. Because of their affiliation with religion, they carry out a prime directive that is specific to the religion they are bound to. However, that doesn't stop other religions from hijacking angels and reprogramming them to follow their goals.  All angels stand at 7 feet tall, have pure white eyes, have skin of solid gold. Often found walking the streets of major cities, these synths are ready to intervene in any conflict, based on their religious programming. Each religion requires a different tactic in dealing with the public. Some require the angels to carry weapons, others require more of a personal touch to dealing with miscreants. ",

But, something created by the volcano could theoretically survive the conditions of the volcano, right? Right. That's what the Narak are. Being birthed by the volcano and living in the volcano's shadow allow them to resist the volcanos effects and live a relatively safe life. Narak are bizarre freaks of nature. Apparently, being thrust from a volcano doesn't exactly give you a sense of humility. A Narak's pride and ego are bigger than the volcano themselves. Many Narak are quick to anger at being challenged at anything and cannot resist proving they are the best at everything they do. In a surprising turn of events, they founded the school for the Ohen, due to the fact they have a natural resistance to fire and bond with it better than other races. Of course, that just lead to more ego inflation amongst the Naraks, so most historians find this to be a horrible move.",
